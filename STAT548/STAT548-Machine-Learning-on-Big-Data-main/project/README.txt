In this project, we applied two nonparametric clustering methods to the data600.npy dataset, which contains n=10000 observations in d=600 dimensions. The first method is level‚Äêset clustering using a kernel density estimator, and using nearest neighbor to assign low density points to clusters. The second method is spectral clustering.
